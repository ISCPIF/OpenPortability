The centralized model, embodied by X (formerly Twitter), is experiencing a massive exodus of users to alternative platforms like BlueSky and Mastodon. Several million accounts have migrated in just a few weeks, marking a major shift towards decentralized and open networks.</p><p>This transition is a major social, economic, and technological phenomenon that may modify the global digital space, particularly in Europe, and could allow Europe to regain some digital sovereignty.</p><h2>I. Project and Processing Description</h2><p>The research objectives are as follows: analyze the difference between open and closed micro-blogging digital environments from the perspective of social dynamics and online debates. Study as a case study the ongoing migration between X and spaces based on open protocols AT Protocol and Activity Pub, and study the appropriation of decentralized digital spaces over time (5-year horizon).</p><p>The OpenPortability project involves:</p><ul><li>Data collection for data portability between social networks</li><li>Data collection for creating a snapshot of X network's social structure</li><li>Data collection for creating snapshots of alternative networks' social structures</li><li>Data portability</li><li>Data processing and analysis</li></ul><h2>II. Data Collection, Recipients, and Retention</h2><p>Data collected directly from individuals and processed are:</p><ul><li>Digital identifiers on social networks (username ID)</li><li>Social network profile names</li><li>Email addresses</li></ul><p>Bluesky's personal data protection policy can be found at: <link>https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy</link></p><p>Mastodon's personal data protection policy can be accessed at <link>https://joinmastodon.org/servers</link></p><h2>III.
