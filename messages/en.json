    "content": "<h2>CNRS ISC PIF</h2><p>Data protection information note in the context of scientific research Open Portability Project</p><p>Social networks and in particular Twitter (now X) have from the beginning constituted privileged research objects, particularly in the field of computational social sciences.</p><p>A historical transition is underway in the landscape of social networks. The centralized model, embodied by X (formerly Twitter), is experiencing a massive exodus of users to alternative platforms such as BlueSky and Mastodon. Several million accounts migrated in a few weeks, marking a major shift towards decentralized and open networks.</p><p>This transition is a major social, economic and technological phenomenon which, perhaps, will transform the global digital space and in particular European and could allow Europe to regain some digital sovereignty.</p><h2>I. Description of the project and processing</h2><p>The objectives of the research are as follows: to analyze the difference between open and closed micro-blogging digital environments from the perspective of social dynamics and online debates. To study as a case study the ongoing migration between X and spaces based on open protocols AT Protocol and Activity Pub and to study the appropriation of decentralized digital spaces over time (5-year horizon).</p><p>The OpenPortability project involves:</p><ul><li>Data collection for data portability between social networks</li><li>Data collection for taking a snapshot of the social structure of the X network</li><li>Data collection for taking snapshots of the social structures of alternative networks</li><li>Data portability</li><li>Data processing and analysis</li></ul><h2>II. Data collection, recipients and retention</h2><p>Data collected directly from individuals and processed are:</p><ul><li>Digital identifiers on social networks (user name ID)</li><li>Profile names on social networks</li><li>Email addresses</li></ul><p>Bluesky's personal data protection policy is available on: <link>https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy</link></p><p>Mastodon's personal data protection policy is available on <link>https://joinmastodon.org/servers</link></p><h2>III.
